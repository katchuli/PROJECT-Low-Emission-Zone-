# PROJECT-Low-Emission-Zone-

## Project Overview

 Low Emission Zones (LEZs) are restricted areas typically located within cities and larger towns, where the circulation of more polluting vehicles is limited. Cities and governments have been adopting LEZ programs as a measure to reduce ambient exposures to air pollution in order to meet EU Air Quality Standards. LEZs are often considered the most effective measure that cities and towns can take to improve air quality by reducing the emissions of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and indirectly ozone (O3), the three main air pollutants of concern in Europe.

The concept of Environmental Zones originated in Sweden in 1996 and can be considered the first LEZ program. Following the Swedish example, Low Emission Zones were implemented in a few cities in Germany, the Netherlands, northern Italy, as well as London in 2007-2008. Since then, the number of LEZs has steadily increased, and they now exist in many EU countries.

In the case of Berlin, the implementation of the LEZ was facilitated through the use of the Green Badge (Grün Plakette). This green badge (Euro 4) allows low-emission vehicles to circulate within the restricted zones, while prohibiting vehicles with yellow and red stickers (Euro 3 and Euro 2) from entering these areas.

## Importance of the Project:

- Addresses the need to assess the impact of LEZs on urban pollution levels.
  
- Provides insights for future environmental policies and urban planning strategies.
  
## Getting Started:

- Familiarize themselves with LEZ concepts and Berlin's "Grün Plakette" system.
 
- Explore methodologies for assessing pollution levels and evaluating LEZ effectiveness.

- Engage in data analysis and interpretation to draw conclusions.

## Getting help 

Refer to relevant literature on air pollution, environmental policies, and urban planning.
